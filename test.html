    <h2>Yummy Yicken</h2>
    <p>So named because the first time I ate it, I could not pronounce the "ch" in "chicken". This meal is hearty and
        comforting, and sure to give you a heart attack.</p>

        <li>Bear Creek Dry Broccoli Cheddar Soup</li>
        <li>8 cups Low fat milk</li>
        <li>1 pound of cheddar cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sear chicken in butter and remove from pan</li>
        <li>Pour milk into pan with chicken drippings. Add soup mix.</li>
        <li>Simmer until thickened. Add half of the cheese, let it melt before stirring. Season with salt and pepper to
            taste</li>
        <li>Put the chicken back in, pour more cheese on top. Cook for 10-15min or until the chicken is cooked through
